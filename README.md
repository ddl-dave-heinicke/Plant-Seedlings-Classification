# Sample-Work

These sample projects include Kaggle competitions, machine learning projects on puplicly avaialble datasets, and datasets I've explored just out of curiosity.

### [Plant Seedlings Competition](https://github.com/dheinicke1/Sample-Work/tree/master/Plant%20Seedlings%20Classification)
An image classification challenge that explores:

- Image masking and pre-procesing
- Data augmentation
- Convolutional neural net models
- Pre-trained image recognition models
- Ensenble image feature models

### [Credit Card Fraud](https://github.com/dheinicke1/CreditCardFraud/blob/master/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection.ipynb)

A notebok that explores how to detect credit card fraud from transaction data

- Explore the effects of SMOTE resampling on a highly imbalanced data set
- Compare the feature importance of Logisitc Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM models

### [Donors Choose](https://github.com/dheinicke1/DonorsChoose)

A challenge to predict the likelikood of a grant application bein accepted.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of grant applications
- Text vectorization and sentiment analysis of application essays
- LightGBM modeling

### [Transit](https://github.com/dheinicke1/Sample-Work/tree/master/Transit)

Public transit ridership in the United States has generally been in decline over the last few years. Why?

A proejct to analyze transit agency and ridership data to determine why some agencies are experiencing a decline while others aren't.
