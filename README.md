# Sample-Work

These sample projects include Kaggle competitions, machine learning projects on puplicly avaialble datasets, and datasets I've explored just out of curiosity.

### [Plant Seedlings Competition](https://github.com/dheinicke1/Sample-Work/blob/master/Plant%20Seedlings%20Classification/README.md)
An image classification challenge that explores:

- Image masking and pre-procesing
- Data augmentation
- Convolutional neural net models
- Pre-trained image recognition models
- Ensenble image feature models

### Credit Card Fraud

A notebok that explores how to detect credit card fraud in a highly imbalanced data set.
