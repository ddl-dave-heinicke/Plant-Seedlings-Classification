Project Under Construction!

[APTA Data Here](https://www.apta.com/resources/statistics/Pages/ridershipreport.aspx)

[FTA Data Here](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-raw-data-release)

## Motivation

1) Transit ridership in teh United States has decreased somewhat in recent years. Why? And Where?

2) Mass transit maps are really inconsistent. What exactly is the difference ebtween light rail, commuter rail, or heavy rail? 
Is there a natural and universal way to classify different system components to create a universal mapping paradigm?
