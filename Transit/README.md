## Background

Public transit ridership in the United States has generally been in decline over the last few years. [This has been attributed to a number of factors](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/falling-transit-ridership-poses-an-emergency-for-cities-experts-fear/2018/03/20/ffb67c28-2865-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html?utm_term=.7996f089b1b8) including a strong economy, lower gas prices and the rise of ride and bike sharing in urban areas. 

But while total nationwide ridership is in decline, some transit agencies and modes are doing just fine, experiencing stable or increasing ridership. Why?

This project digs through APTA and FTA agency and ridership data, and using machine learning, looks for clues for what predicts ridership decline. Transit agencies don't have much control over gas prices, competition from ride sharing or changes in commuting behavior, but maybe a systematic comparison of transit agencies can provide actionable insight in how to improve public transportation networks and improve ridership.
